* Country-based personalized data-driven password meter, based on [PESrank model](https://github.com/lirondavid/PESrank).

## Installation
* Unzip PPESrank-master into a directory of your choise.
* Run:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
## Run the Python Server
* In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project folder and run the Python server:
  ```bash
  python app.py
  ```
* You should see output indicating that the Flask development server is running.
  Here's an example of what the terminal output might look like:
  ```bash
   * Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
   * Environment: development
   * Debug mode: on
   * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
  ```
## Accessing the Flask Application
* Once you see this output, your Flask server is up and running and ready to handle incoming HTTP requests.
* To access the Flask application, open a web browser and enters the URL of the application in the address bar.
  This URL typically consists of the host and port where your Flask server is running (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or http://localhost:5000/).
